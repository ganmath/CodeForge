# Scaffolding Prompt
Use this to regenerate the CodeForge skeleton (paste into Amazon Q / ChatGPT).

```
You are a 25+ year Java Architect and Prompt Engineer.
Generate a complete repository as a single ZIP named `codeforge-skeleton-v4.zip`.
It must run locally without Docker, deploy to AWS, and include a GitHub Wiki pack.
No business logic â€” only skeleton, connectivity, tests, infra, and docs.
[... same meta-prompt as in the request ...]
```
